# Spotifake
my take on creating a Spotify-look-alike.

![alt text](https://github.com/JStrebeyko/Spotifake/blob/master/public/Player_more.jpg)

Apparently, here is a red-hot version of how shoult it look like (still some features are missing, namely the playing album middle icon or spinning records): https://dribbble.com/shots/4222790-Daftplayer-prototype
## Features
```
core:
[v] right 'more' menu
[v] album covers slider
[v] play button with state
[v] playlist menu
[v] responsiveness
```
```
additional:
[v] btn component, some toggleable
[v] dataset from outside
```

## Project setup
```
yarn / npm i
```

### Run and see
```
yarn serve / npm run serve
```
